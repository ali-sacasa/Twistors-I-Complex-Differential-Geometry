# Topological-Twistores-and-Complex-Differential-Geometry
## Author: Sebastián Alí Sacasa Céspedes, University of Costa Rica
This repository contains computational laboratories accompanying the course   “Twistors I: Differential Complex Geometry”

### Computational Laboratory for an Advanced Seminar

The goal is to provide **minimal, conceptually faithful implementations** of
key ideas from twistor theory, emphasizing geometry, structure, and interpretation
rather than brute-force computation.

## Contents

- Geometric construction of twistor space
- Incidence relations and CP¹ geometry
- Minimal Penrose transform for massless fields
- Dolbeault formulation of sheaf cohomology
- Microlocal interpretation of twistors
- Directional lifting of singularities

This repository also explores a geometric bridge between twistor theory, complex differential geometry and
Topological Data Analysis (TDA).

From this perspective:
- Persistent homology corresponds to stable cohomological structures.
- Directional information is encoded via twistor lifting.
- Robust features arise from geometric invariance, not metric precision.

This provides a mathematically grounded framework for applying advanced
geometry to data analysis, complex systems, and economics.

This repository does **not** aim to provide a full numerical solver.
Instead, it focuses on:

- Structural understanding
- Geometric intuition
- Reproducible minimal examples
- Interdisciplinary accessibility

The code is intentionally simple and transparent.
